Multiwfn quick start
Tian Lu (sobereva@sina.com)
Last update: 2025-Apr-13, corresponding to Multiwfn manual version 3.8(dev)
The Multiwfn manual is very detailedly written and well organized, however, it is relatively
long. In order to make new user of Multiwfn quickly get started, here I provide a very short quick
start document, which presents answer to a few frequently asked questions and basic guides on how
to perform common tasks.

1. FAQ
 Q: What analysis can Multiwfn do? What is the use of Multiwfn?
A: Please check "Overview" page of Multiwfn website or Chapter 1 of Multiwfn manual.
 Q: Where can I obtain latest Multiwfn program and manual?
A: The Multiwfn official website is http://sobereva.com/multiwfn, all resources related to
Multiwfn can be freely acquired from this site. I highly suggest you frequently check this site to
update your Multiwfn to the latest version, since development and update of Multiwfn are very
active.
 Q: How to cite Multiwfn in most correct way?
A: Check How to cite Multiwfn.pdf document in Multiwfn binary package.
 Q: What should I do when I encounter problems in using Multiwfn?
A: Please always pay attention to all prompts on screen and do not forget to check
corresponding section of Multiwfn manual. If you are unable to easily find solution, please do not
hesitate to post message on Multiwfn forum, the English forum is http://sobereva.com/wfnbbs, the
Chinese forum is http://bbs.keinsci.com/wfn. Commonly, the developer checks these two forums
every day and always timely replies questions.
 Q: What is the smoothest and quick way of learning Multiwfn?
A: Reading Chapter 1, Sections 2.1~2.5 of Chapter 2, and then follow the tutorials in Chapter
4. After that if you want to learn more about theoretical backgrounds and details of Multiwfn, then
read Section 2.6~2.8 of Chapter 2 and Chapter 3. Note that the tutorials and examples given in
Chapter 4 only cover most important and frequently used functions rather than all functions of
Multiwfn. By the way, there is a Youtube channel of Multiwfn, in which there are some video
illustrations for special topics.
 Q: How to install Multiwfn?
A: Check Section 2.1.
 Q: Which format of input file can be used?
A: Check Section 2.3.

 Q: How to generate input files for Multiwfn?
A: Check beginning of Chapter 4. Almost all mainstream quantum chemistry codes can at least
generate one kind of input file that supported by Multiwfn for wavefunction analysis purpose.
 Q: Can Multiwfn analyze periodic systems?
A: Yes, please check Section 2.9 of manual for detail.
 Q: Why Multiwfn occasionally suddenly exits?
A: Possible reasons:
(1) The format of input file is inappropriate for present task. Please carefully check the
corresponding section of the manual on the requirement of input file.
(2) The input file is problematic or incomplete. Please regenerate it or open it using text editor
to check for abnormalities.
(3) Your operation steps are incorrect or the command you inputted is wrong and thus cannot
be recognized. Please always carefully check prompts on screen, or try to reproduce the
corresponding examples in the manual before using Multiwfn to study your system.
(4) Insufficient of memory. If you are using Win32 version of Multiwfn, please change to the
Win64 one. You can also try to increase "ompstacksize" in settings.ini. If you are using Linux
version, please make sure you have properly configured your system according to Section 2.1.
(5) If your task relies on NBO output file and meantime diffuse functions are employed, remove
diffuse functions and try again.
(6) Due to bug of Multiwfn. Please report it to developer on Multiwfn official forum.
 Q: Why Multiwfn crashes under Linux and show error "Segmentation fault"?
A: Commonly this is because you didn't strictly follow Section 2.1.2 to configure your system.
If you are really unable to solve this problem, please use Windows version. If your input file is
problematic, you may also encounter this problem.
 Q: How to copy output of Multiwfn from console window to text file?
A: See Section 5.4.
 Q: How to run Multiwfn using command line mode? How to use Multiwfn process a
batch of input files?
A: See Sections 5.2 and 5.3.
 Q: The console window cannot record all printed information, the older output was
flushed out
A: Increase buffer size of the console window so that the window can record more lines of
output, see Sections 5.5.
 Q: I don't understand meaning of each column of the text file outputted by Multiwfn
A: Please carefully check prompts on screen. Bear in mind, when Multiwfn exports a file, the
meaning of each column is always clearly shown.
 Q: What is the unit of the data outputted by Multiwfn?
A: Unless otherwise specified, all units are in atomic unit (a.u.). When Multiwfn exports a text
file, the unit is always explicitly shown on screen.
 Q: I can't find the file(s) exported by Multiwfn

A: If Multiwfn doesn't explicitly ask you to input the path of the file for exporting, the file is
always generated in current folder. The meaning of "current folder" has clearly been mentioned in
page 2 of the manual.
 Q: Electrostatic potential analysis (ESP) is slow for large system
A: Calculating ESP is significantly more expensive than calculating most other real space
functions. If you are calculating ESP grid data (e.g. in main function 5, or in basin analysis module)
I strongly suggest making Multiwfn invoke cubegen utility in Gaussian package to significantly
speed up the calculation, see Section 5.7. However, for other kind of ESP analysis, invoking cubegen
will never bring benefit and is thus deprecated.
 Q: Multiwfn is failed to invoke Gaussian to perform calculation under Windows
system with error "No executable for file l1.exe"
A: See Appendix 1 of manual. You need to set up GAUSS_EXEDIR environment variable in
your system.
 Q: How to load a new file without rebooting Multiwfn?
A: Return to main menu, input r (meaning “reload”).
 Q: How to quit Multiwfn?
A: Press Ctrl+C or directly close the window. If you want to exit gracefully, input q in the main
function menu.
